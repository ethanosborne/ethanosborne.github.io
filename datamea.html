          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>DataMea was created as a solution for the problem of creating an email dashboard application for my Software Design course. The professor instructed us to create this app with any technology we saw fit, as long as it contained certain functions that he wanted, including: a heatmap for when emails are sent and received most, a chart showing who sends the user the most emails, and a sentiment gauge that showed the extent of how positive or negative the users email inbox was. You can view the website <a class="proj_link" href="https://datamea.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h1>Persona Creation</h1>
          <p>Early on, the usability team was tasked with creating User Personas for who we thought would be the target audience of the app. Since I knew that my professor was one of the target audience, I decided to make a persona based on a college professor. One of the things that I knew DataMea could be used for was learning about email habits, so I decided that I would make it so Charles was looking to create better habits. With a full class load, it is hard to be on top of emails from students and using the statistics from DataMea is a way that could help someone in his position.</p>

          <h1>Prototype</h1>
          <p>This is a prototype that was created by another team member and me in Axure. The professor, who was also the stakeholder, wanted to see a working protoype that would "reload" based on filter application. To do this, we created multiple pages based on fake data that would reload to give the appearance of a filter being applied. Most of the graphs we used were from Google charts due to the ability to easily input fake data and the ability to insert them into Axure. This was a low-fidelity protoype, the important things were to view a potential layout, color scheme, and graph interactions. To view the whole protoype, go <a class="proj_link" href="https://vt85hm.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home&c=1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h1>Usability Test</h1>
          <p>For the final usability test, it was determined that the participants would go through a set of tasks that the usability team created. Some of the tasks are pictured to the right. In addition to the tasks, the participants would also be answering a survey that was set up so we could learn how easy to understand the product was, how easy to use it was, and how aesthetically pleasing it was. Some results of the survey can be seen <a class="proj_link" href="img/final_survey.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Unfortunately, due to time and feasability constraints, we were not able to hit the aforementioned target audience. However, results indicated that we hit all of our targets and that DataMea was a usable application.</p>

          <h1>Final Product</h1>
          <p>This is the final iteration of DataMea, it was built in Java and can be downloaded to any computer that uses Windows or macOS. There were changes made from the initial wireframe, due to both time constraints and technological constraints. There is no list of filters, they need to be applied by clicking on the graphs that are filterable and applied in a menu that appears once you have clicked a filter. The sidebar turned into the hidden hamburger menu system that included some setting options as well as the folder structure of the email account. Overall, this project was a good first step for me into what a UX role might look like at a company and I am excited to bring the skills I learned into the work place.</p>
