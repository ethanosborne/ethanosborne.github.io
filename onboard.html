          <h1>Background</h1>
          <p>This project was a concept of an app that would help the onboarding of new employees at Pinckney Hugo Group, an advertising agency in Syracuse, NY. This is an image of the final prototype, the process will be outlined below to show the different steps that were taken to complete this project. This was done for my research methods class using the IDEO methodology. A complete PDF of my final powerpoint can be viewed <a class="proj_link" href="img/ppt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h1>Cognitive Walkthrough</h1>
          <p>For the cognitive walkthrough, the task that was chosen was to watch a video that the video department had created. Results of this method showed that the wording was to dense and needed to be simplified so users would understand it better. As will be shown later, having a video component was a part of an early idea, and was later taken away due to feasibility issues. Regardless, it was helpful to learn that using larger words might take away from the UX of the rest of the application.</p>

          <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
          <p>For this task analysis, I focused on what the user would have to do to find the directions to a certain employee if they were just opening the app. Results are shown to the left, as you can see there are not many steps and most are done in a specific order so it is not very confusing to the user. If I had the time and the ability to do so, I would like to run a task analysis on all of the important tasks and not just a single one.</p>

          <h1>Storyboard</h1>
          <p>The storyboard was created to simulate what it would be like for an employee to use the app to learn some facts about the VP (in this case) they were going to meet, and then get directions to the VPâ€™s office. Here you can see that there are four steps before the user reaches the employee card, which should be looked at in the future. This might be too many and could deter someone from using the app. It is a lower fidelity storyboard, but it shows the major steps needed to get through the app.</p>

          <h1>First Prototype</h1>
          <p>The first iteration of the prototype was created to showcase all of the important information that was gleaned from the previous research methods alongside other ones. There was a one person user testing session done for this version of the prototype and the results are as follows. The results of the survey were overall positive. The participant felt that the information flowed well, he liked the idea of the app and what it could be used for. The one thing that he found a problem with was that there was the link that said G-chat, but nothing happened when the link was clicked. All of my questions were answered and I had changes to make for my second iteration.</p>

          <h1>Final Prototype</h1>
          <p>This final prototype was created based on feedback from the user test as well as asking my supervisor at work. Through them I was able to gather that I should focus less on colors, and more on the important functions of the app, which is why I included a mockup of a Gchat and make the sure the information flowed better. Another one person usability test was done for this prototype, and results are as follows. The results of the survey were mixed. This participant felt that the information did not flow well, but he saw feasibility of the app and what it could be used for. He believed that this would be good for new employees, and he wished that he had it as a new employee. Overall, this project showed me that all user expectations can not be met, and it is about finding the best solution that encompasses the best of all user input.</p>
